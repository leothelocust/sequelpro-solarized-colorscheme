ColorScheme for Sequel Pro
==========================================

In an effort to more closely match the real Ethan Schoonover Solarized colors, I've made this version of syntax highlighting for [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/).

[kylewest](https://github.com/kylewest/solarized) does a pretty good job with this already, but the color palette is a bit different than Ethan Schoonover's original design.

If you are looking for the closest Sequel Pro Theme using Solarized colors, look no further.

Installation instructions
=========================

Import the `.spTheme` files within the Sequel Pro preferences.

Once the theme is imported select `Save Current Theme As...` to allow quick switching between the light and dark color schemes.
